# Pico Platform - Beta

A platform that exposes Lutron Pico Remotes to Homekit as buttons.  Supports single, double, and long press actions.

## Requirements

[Lutron Caseta Pro bridge](https://www.casetawireless.com/proproducts)

This plugin will not work with the standard Caseta bridge.

## Why do we need this platform

Lutron Pico Remote are a seemless way to add virtual control to any homekit device or scene.

## Installation instructions

After [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) has been installed:

 `sudo npm install -g homebridge-pico`

In the Lutron mobile app go to configure, choose Advanced, and then Integration.  Enable Telnet Support.  You can also choose to "Send Integration Report" here and it will email you the device list with IDs for your bridge.

Configure the plugin with `quiet` set to false.  Add your Pico remotes to your Lutron Pro bridge.  You do not have to associate the Pico remotes with Lutron lights.  Simply push any button on the Pico remote you'd like to add to this plugin and you'll see a log entry like this in homebridge:

`[6/13/2020, 11:14:23] [Pico] [<bridge IP>] Bus Data: ~DEVICE,63,2,3`

The number after `DEVICE` is the ID of the Pico remote you just pressed.


## Example config.json:

```json
{
  "bridge": {
      ...
  },
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "Pico",
      "quiet": false,
      "servers": [
        {
          "host": "<IP Address or Host Name>",
          "port": 80,
          "switches": [
            {
              "name": "Kitchen Pico",
              "pico": 22,
              "type": "simple"
            },
            {
             "name": "Home Theater Pico",
             "pico": [11,31],
             "type": "scene"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`servers`: You can have one or more Lutro Caseta Pro bridges

`host`: IP Address or hostname of the Lutron Caseta Pro bridge

`port`: Port to use for the Lutron Caseta Pro bridge (default: 23)

`switches`: List of the Pico remotes to be exposed to Homekit

* `name`: Name of the remote as it will appear in HomeKit
* `pico`: One or more Pico Remotes that will trigger the Homekit button
* `type`:
  * `simple`: Basic two button Pico - on/off
  * `dimmer`:  Four button Pico - on/brighten/dim/off
  * `favorite`:  Five buttom Pico - on/brigthen/favorite/dim/off
  * `scene`: Four button Pico - scene 1/scene 2/scene 3/off
  * If you aren't sure what type to choose, the 2nd number after "DEVICE" in the log is the button pressed.  You can press the buttons on the Pico remote and compare the output to the list in `accessory.js`.  If you find you have buttons configured differently, or not in the list, please let me know and I'll add your Pico.


### Optional platform settings:

`quiet`: If set to `true`, logging will only happen for errors.  If not present or set to "false", log will show Lutron bus activity.  This logging is extremely handy for identifying a Pico remote. (default: `false`)

`clicktime`:  The timeout for detecting a doubleclick in milliseconds.  (default: 500)
